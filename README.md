# VS Code Environment Exemplify Extension

This extension automatically creates a copy of an `.env` file as an `.env.example` file and updates it whenever changes are saved to the reference env. file.. This is particularly useful for keeping a sample environment configuration file up-to-date in projects where environment variables are used.
